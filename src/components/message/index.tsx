                <strong>SED (South Punjab) Multan</strong> is also striving for quality education and transitioning to a
                digital system of education across the eleven districts of South Punjab. The
                <strong> Chief Executive Officer (DEA) Bahawalpur </strong>
                is playing a significant role in this transformation.
            </p>
            <p className={getMerriWeather.className}>
                There are <strong>192 boys and girls high and higher secondary schools</strong> in the region, with over{" "}
                <strong>25,000 students enrolled</strong>. These schools are supported by{" "}
                <strong>3,215 teaching staff</strong> and <strong>1,200 non-teaching staff.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className={getMerriWeather.className}>
                Bahawalpur is already showing strong performance in both academic and co-curricular activities. The{" "}
                <strong>launch of the Chief Executive Officer (DEA) Bahawalpur&rsquo;s website</strong> marks a key
                milestone towards making Bahawalpur a leader in South Punjabâ€™s education sector.

                I would like to appreciate the <strong>Digital Team of Secondary Wing Bahawalpur</strong> and extend my
                prayers for their continued success in maintaining this momentum.
